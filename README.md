### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/SBuxton-IDM/EquityMilestone.git
```
2. **Create New Branch**:  Before making changes, create a new branch for your work.
```
git branch my_changes
git checkout my_changes
```

### Making changes
**Commit your change and push to your branch**
```
git add changed_file
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin
```
**Open a pull request**

Pull requests are the best way to keep track of ongoing and completed work. Once you open github in a browser, if you have made recent changes to a branch you will see a prompt "branch [branch name] has recent changes would you like to open a pull request?"

1. Select "open pull request"
2. If you are addressing some issue, paste a link to the issue into your PR. This will show the creator of the issue that you are done/working on it.
3. If you just want to show that you're working on an issue but not quite done, create a "draft pull request".
4. If someone assigned you to an issue, it's best practice to add them as a "reviewer" to the PR before merging into `main`.
5. If you are a reviewer, it is best practice to be specific about the changes you want to see, and to merge it in when those changes are made.
